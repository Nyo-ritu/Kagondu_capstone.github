Kagondu_capstone.github
This app pulls football stats from an api from 6 major soccer leagues (in the UK, France, Spain, Italy, Germany and the USA).

It is 100% created within the Flask framework.

It has full functionality regarding allowing users to sign up, sign in, log out, see their profile, and navigate between pages, within an easy to use interface.

It currently has 30 different api calls, with endless capacity to gather more data.

Its limitations are mostly to do with storing previously pulled data once the next api call is made.

Add tables to the database to allow users to store preferences(teams, players they like, that that are connected to api calls they can make to retrieve updated info on), move forward from table presentation to graphs/charts, pull logos and pictures, and so on.
